# Ramen-Shop--The-Game
 fun lil mini game w/ pygame!!
 
 Goals: Will optimize OOP at later date. Will slowly make this game more advanced -- levels, a more complex UI, a local leaderboard, etc. 
 
Thanks for checking out Tan's Ramen Shop :) 
 
 For the ramen lovers (mainly me) üçúü•¢ 
 
Catch the soft eggs in your bowl! Watch out for the cracked ones. Once 3 land in your bowl, it's game over. Right now, there's not an end in sight as there's no way to actually 'win' the game, haha. Hopefully you obtain the same satisfaction from trying to beat your own highscore?
